## Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. Import Pattern Error ✅ FIXED
**Previous Failure**:
```monkey-c
using Toybox.Application as App;
class SleepBetterApp extends App.AppBase { }
// ERROR: Cannot resolve super class
```

**Solution Implemented**:
```monkey-c
using Toybox.Application;
class SleepBetterApp extends Application.AppBase { }
// ✅ Compiles successfully
```

### 2. Missing Lang Import ✅ FIXED
**Previous Failure**: Type errors for Number, Float, Boolean, String

**Solution**: Added `using Toybox.Lang;` to all source files

### 3. Timer Memory Leak ✅ PREVENTED
**Risk**: Timer continuing after view hidden

**Solution**: Implemented cleanup in onHide():
```monkey-c
function onHide() as Void {
    if (_timer != null) {
        _timer.stop();
        _timer = null;
    }
}
```

### 4. Time Jump on Resume ✅ PREVENTED
**Risk**: Session jumping forward after pause/resume

**Solution**: Reset timestamp on resume:
```monkey-c
_lastTickTime = Time.now().value();
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Critical Path Tests (Priority 1)
1. Build compilation (0 errors, 0 warnings)
2. App launch on simulator
3. Basic breathing cycle (4-7-8 timing)
4. Pause/resume without time jump
5. Session completion

### Feature Tests (Priority 2)
1. Intro animation
2. Outro message
3. Haptic feedback (if device supports)
4. Settings persistence
5. Progress ring accuracy

### Performance Tests (Priority 3)
1. Memory usage monitoring
2. Battery drain measurement
3. 30-minute stress test
4. Timer leak verification
5. Frame rate consistency

### Edge Case Tests (Priority 4)
1. Rapid tap during intro
2. Multiple pause/resume cycles
3. App backgrounding mid-session
4. Low battery behavior
5. Memory pressure handling

---

## Known Issues / Limitations

### None Critical
No critical bugs or blocking issues identified in current implementation.

### Minor Limitations
1. **Session length fixed**: Currently 8 cycles (architecture supports variable)
2. **English only**: Strings ready for localization but not implemented
3. **No settings UI**: Haptics toggle requires code change
4. **Single breathing pattern**: Only 4-7-8 implemented (architecture extensible)

### Platform Limitations
1. **No CSS effects**: MonkeyC doesn't support blur/gradients (workarounds implemented)
2. **10fps max**: Battery constraints (acceptable for breathing guidance)
3. **System fonts only**: No custom typography (adequate for purpose)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Comprehensive Planning**: sleepbetter_plan2.md was invaluable
2. **Troubleshooting Documentation**: Avoided previous import errors
3. **Incremental Approach**: Each step validated before proceeding
4. **Reference Implementation**: HTML prototype provided clear target

### Key Insights
1. **Import Pattern Critical**: MonkeyC import syntax must be exact
2. **Timer Cleanup Essential**: Memory leaks are real concern
3. **10fps Adequate**: Smooth enough for breathing, battery efficient
4. **Module vs Class**: MonkeyC supports both patterns effectively

### Recommendations for Future Projects
1. Always review troubleshooting docs first
2. Validate import patterns early
3. Implement timer cleanup from start
4. Test on physical device regularly
5. Document as you code
